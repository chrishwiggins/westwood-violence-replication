# Reproducing "Current Research Overstates American Support for Political Violence"

**Westwood et al. (2022) PNAS**

DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2116870119

---

# Part 1: The Paper

## Core Claim

Prior survey research reports ~20% of Americans support political violence.

**Westwood et al. argue this is inflated by 3-8x** due to:
1. Survey satisficing (disengaged respondents)
2. Measurement error in abstract questions
3. Correlation inflation in correlates analysis

---

# The Problem: Survey Satisficing

**Satisficing** = respondents who don't engage with survey content

- Click through without reading
- Random or careless responses
- Fail comprehension checks

These respondents systematically inflate violence support estimates.

---

# Study Design Overview

# The Engagement Screen

Respondents classified as **Engaged** or **Disengaged** based on comprehension:

```r
# preprocess1.R:127-129
study1$passed <- "Disengaged Respondent"
study1$passed[study1$Q43 == "Florida" &
              study1$partisantreatment==1] <- "Engaged Respondent"
study1$passed[study1$Q49 == "Oregon" &
              study1$partisantreatment==2] <- "Engaged Respondent"
```

Simple factual question: "In what state did the incident occur?"

---

# Key Finding: Engagement Matters

![bg right:45% fit](results/plot2.pdf)

**Study 1** (Political treatments):
- Engaged: 12.1%
- Disengaged: 37.9%
- Ratio: **3.1x**

**Study 2** (Political treatments):
- Engaged: 4.4%
- Disengaged: 33.8%
- Ratio: **7.7x**

# Figure 2: The Core Result

Three dependent variables across Studies 1-3:

**Panel A**: "Suspect is Justified"
**Panel B**: "Support for Suspect"
**Panel C**: "Suspect Should be Charged"

Orange = Disengaged (fail check)
Blue = Engaged (pass check)

Generated by `figure2.R` (232 lines)

# Code: Computing Engagement Differences

```r
# figure2.R:7-14
plot1ajustifieddata <- study1 %>%
  group_by(alignment, passed) %>%
  summarise(smean = mean(justified, na.rm = TRUE),
            ssd = sd(justified, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n()) %>%
  mutate(se = ssd / sqrt(count),
         lower = lower_ci(smean, se, count),
         upper = upper_ci(smean, se, count))
```

Standard error: $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

# Code: Figure 1 Histogram

```r
# figure1.R:5 - kme = "Kalmoe-Mason Estimates"
kme <- read_csv("../data/priorestimates.csv")

# figure1.R:22-36
all <- ggplot(data=kme[!is.na(kme$PartisansSupport),],

# Figure 3: Response Distributions

![bg right:45% fit](results/plot3.pdf)

Distribution of responses by engagement status.

Disengaged respondents show:
- More uniform distributions
- Less differentiation by condition
- Classic satisficing pattern

---

# The Kalmoe-Mason Measure (2019)

Abstract question used in prior research:

> "When, if ever, is it OK for [party] to use violence?"

```r
# preprocess1.R:96-99
data$Q32 <- recode(data$Q32,
  "Strongly agree" = 5, "Somewhat agree" = 4,
  "Neither agree nor disagree" = 3,
  "Somewhat disagree" = 2, "Strongly disagree" = 1)
```

Problem: Abstract questions allow satisficing without detection.

---

# Figure 4: The Key Test

**Research question**: Does abstract self-reported support for violence (the Kalmoe-Mason style question) actually predict concrete judgments about specific violent acts?

This is the central validity test of the paper.

If abstract measures are valid, people who say "violence is justified" in the abstract should also say specific violent acts are justified.

---

# Figure 4: Variables Explained

**Outcome variable (Y)**: `justified`
- Binary (0/1): Did respondent say the driver's action was "Justified" or "Unjustified"?
- This is the *concrete* measure - judgment about a specific vignette

**Predictor 1**: `Q77` (1-5 Likert scale)
- "To what extent is political violence justified?"
- This is the *abstract* Kalmoe-Mason (2019) style measure
- 1 = "Not at all" ... 5 = "A great deal"

**Predictor 2**: `alignment` (experimental condition)
- **In-Party Driver**: Perpetrator shares respondent's party
- **Out-Party Driver**: Perpetrator is from opposing party
- **Apolitical Driver**: No party mentioned (control)

---

# Figure 4: The OLS Model

$$\text{justified}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{alignment}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Q77}_i + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{alignment}_i \times \text{Q77}_i) + \epsilon_i$$

**What each term tests:**

| Term | Question |
|------|----------|
| $\beta_0$ | Baseline: What % say justified when Q77=1 and Apolitical? |
| $\beta_1$ | Does In-Party vs Out-Party change judgments (at Q77=1)? |
| $\beta_2$ | Does higher abstract endorsement predict concrete endorsement? |
| $\beta_3$ | Does the Q77 effect *differ* by alignment? (interaction) |

---

# Figure 4: Key Coefficients

```
                         Estimate  Std.Err  t-value   p-value
(Intercept)                0.101    0.019    5.33    <0.001 ***
Q77f5                      0.536    0.065    8.24    <0.001 ***
alignmentIn-Party:Q77f4    0.269    0.121    2.22     0.027 *
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Intercept (0.101)**: Only ~10% say violence is justified at baseline (Q77=1, Apolitical)

- **Q77f5 (0.536)**: People who say "5 - A great deal" on the abstract question are 54 percentage points more likely to say the vignette violence was justified

- **Interaction (0.269)**: At Q77=4, In-Party alignment adds an *extra* 27pp beyond main effects

---

# Figure 4: What the Plot Shows

![bg right:45% fit](results/plot4.pdf)

Each row = a level of Q77 (abstract self-report)

Each point = predicted probability of saying "justified" for that Q77 level and alignment condition

**Pattern**: Higher Q77 → higher probability of concrete endorsement, but the relationship isn't perfect

---

# Figure 4: The Takeaway

**Abstract measures do predict concrete judgments** - $R^2 = 0.23$

But **23% of variance explained is not great** for a validity check.

If abstract and concrete measures were capturing the same underlying attitude, we'd expect much higher correlation.

**Implication**: Abstract questions like "When is violence OK?" measure something different from concrete judgments about specific acts. The Kalmoe-Mason measure conflates:
- True violence endorsement
- Satisficing/random responding
- Hypothetical vs. realistic scenarios

---

# Figure 5: Sentencing Task (Study 4)

![bg right:45% fit](results/plot5.pdf)

Concrete behavioral measure: proposed prison sentences.

Crimes: vandalism, assault, manslaughter

Tests whether respondents distinguish crime severity.

---

# Figure 6: Correlates Inflation

![bg right:45% fit](results/plot6.pdf)

**Panel A**: Aggression predicts passing engagement test
**Panel B**: Distribution of aggression by engagement

High aggression $\rightarrow$ more likely to be disengaged

This inflates aggression-violence correlations.

---

# Code: Figure 6 Analysis

```r
# figure6.R:5-20
prop <- ggplot(study2,
               aes(x = bussperryc01, y = passed01)) +
  geom_smooth(color="#D55E00", fill="#D55E00") +
  ylab("Proportion Passing Engagement Test") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1))
```

Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (1992; 12 items, `preprocess1.R:78-91`)

---

# Correlates Inflation: The Math

If $\rho(\text{Aggression}, \text{Disengagement}) > 0$

And disengaged respondents inflate violence support...

Then $\rho(\text{Aggression}, \text{Violence Support})$ is **spuriously inflated**.

Paper finds:
- All respondents, K-M measure: r = 0.82
- Engaged only, precise measure: r = 0.20
- **4x inflation**

---

# Part 2: Partial Identification Bounds

What would disengaged respondents answer if they were truly engaged?

We can't observe this, but we can **bound** it.

---

# The Partial ID Model

Let:
- $Y$ = observed outcome (support violence)
- $C$ = engagement indicator (1 = passed check)
- $g$ = guess rate on comprehension check

True support among engaged population:
$$\theta \in \left[ E[Y] + \frac{a \cdot P(C=0) - E[Y(1-C)]}{1-g}, \; E[Y] + \frac{b \cdot P(C=0) - E[Y(1-C)]}{1-g} \right]$$

where $a, b$ bound what disengaged would answer if engaged.

---

# Code: Partial Bounds Function

```r
# partial_id_bounds.R:1-30
partial_bounds <- function(outcome, check, guess_rate,
                           a = 0, b = 1, conf_level = 0.95) {
  Delta_coef_lo <- c(1, a/(1-guess_rate), -1/(1-guess_rate))
  Delta_coef_hi <- c(1, b/(1-guess_rate), -1/(1-guess_rate))

  X <- cbind(outcome, (1 - check), outcome * (1 - check))
  Xbar <- colMeans(X)
  root_N <- sqrt(nrow(X))

  theta_lo <- c(Delta_coef_lo %*% Xbar)
  theta_hi <- c(Delta_coef_hi %*% Xbar)
  # ... variance via delta method
}
```

---

# Delta Method for Variance

The bounds are functions of sample means. Variance computed via:

$$\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) = \nabla f(\bar{X})^T \cdot \text{Cov}(\bar{X}) \cdot \nabla f(\bar{X})$$

```r
# partial_id_bounds.R:13-16
V_X <- cov(X)
sd_lo <- sqrt(c(t(Delta_coef_lo) %*% V_X %*% Delta_coef_lo))
sd_hi <- sqrt(c(t(Delta_coef_hi) %*% V_X %*% Delta_coef_hi))
```

---

# Partial ID Results

With assumption that disengaged would answer 0-20% if engaged:

**95% CI for true support: [0.94%, 6.86%]**

```r
# partial_id_bounds.R:45-46
partial_bounds(outcome = study3partialID$y1,
               check = study3partialID$c,
               guess_rate = 1.0/7.0,
               a = 0, b = 0.25) * 100
```

Far below the 20%+ reported in prior research.

# Reproducibility Challenges Encountered

1. **Package compilation**: RcppArmadillo required C++14
   - Fix: Update `~/.R/Makevars` to not force C++11

2. **NA handling**: Study 3 had NA alignment values
   - Fix: Filter before weighted analysis (`figure2.R:26`)

3. **File format**: .tab files needed conversion to CSV

4. **SI Appendix**: Cloudflare protection required Playwright

# Code Fix: NA Alignment Issue

Original code failed on Study 3 weighted analysis:

```r
# figure2.R:25-32 (FIXED)
plot1cjustifieddata <- study3 %>%
  filter(!is.na(alignment)) %>%  # Added this line
  group_by(alignment, passed) %>%
  summarise(smean = weighted.mean(justified, w=weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            # ... weighted CI computation
            lower = weighted.ttest.ci(justified, weights=weight)[1],
            upper = weighted.ttest.ci(justified, weights=weight)[2])
```

---

# Weighted Analysis for YouGov Data

Study 3 uses survey weights for population representativeness:

```r
# functions.R:8-20
weighted.ttest.ci <- function(x, weights, conf.level = 0.95) {
  require(Hmisc)
  nx <- length(x)
  df <- nx - 1
  vx <- Hmisc::wtd.var(x, weights, normwt = TRUE)
  mx <- weighted.mean(x, weights)
  stderr <- sqrt(vx/nx)
  # ... t-distribution CI
}
```

---

# Sample Size Verification

| Study 1 | 1,002 | 1,002 |
| Study 2 | 1,023 | 1,023 |
| Study 3 | 1,863 | 1,863 |

```r
# run_core.R output
# Study 1 loaded: n = 1002
# Study 2 loaded: n = 1023
```

---

# Key Results Verification

**Study 1 - Political treatments:**
```
  passed                prop_justified     n
  Disengaged Respondent          0.379   169
  Engaged Respondent             0.121   315
```

**Study 2 - Political treatments:**
```
  passed                prop_justified     n
  Disengaged Respondent         0.338    136
  Engaged Respondent            0.0437   572
```

# Statistical Methods Summary

1. **Proportions**: $\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$

2. **Weighted means**: $\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum w_i x_i}{\sum w_i}$

3. **OLS regression**: $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$

4. **Partial identification**: Bounds on unobserved counterfactual

5. **Delta method**: Variance of transformed statistics

---

# Implications for Survey Research

1. **Always include engagement checks**
   - Simple factual questions about vignettes
   - Screen or stratify by engagement

2. **Beware abstract questions**
   - "When is violence OK?" invites satisficing
   - Concrete vignettes reveal true attitudes

3. **Correlates may be spurious**
   - Disengagement correlates with many traits
   - Inflates apparent relationships

---

# The Bottom Line

Prior research reported ~20% support for political violence.

**True estimate: likely 2-7%**

The difference: survey satisficing, not political radicalization.
